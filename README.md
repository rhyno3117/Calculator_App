Hello, I made this project to help better my skills with coding and different frameworks. I build this one using React.js, HTML, and CSS. I was having trouble publishing this to github pages and in the end I lost my src file with all my javascript code inside of it. I am going to figure out how to get that back and if not just re write the code. But the application works and all the functions of the calculator seem to still work so I am a bit confused.
